## Introduction

**Terra nullius** is a Latin term meaning "nobody's land." It refers to a principle sometimes used in international law to describe territory that has never been subject to the sovereignty of any state, or over which any prior sovereign has expressly or implicitly relinquished sovereignty. This concept has been historically used to justify the acquisition of lands by colonial powers.

## `terra nul`

**terra nul** is a hypothetical digital landscape devoid of data, functionality, or purpose. It is a realm where variables are uninitialized, pointers lead to nowhere, and code exists in a state of perpetual limbo. `terra nul` symbolizes a blank slate, a territory waiting to be defined, populated, and given meaning by the flow of `0`s and `1`s through the ether. Unlike **Terra nullius**, the no-where/thing that is `terra nul` cannot be colonized.
